## Basic Auth

author: Josiah Green
version: 1.0.0;

## Overview

This program creates an account and saves it's users password securely, and sends a token for the client to access all of their data.

## Getting Started

To start server please verify that you have installed mongoDB and mongoose then run the following code in your command line `npm run dbon`.

This will allow us to connect to our MongoDB (process.env.MONGODB_URI).  Mongoose acts as the middleware that connects us from our computer to the MongoDB.
